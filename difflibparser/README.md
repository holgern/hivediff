difflibparser is a simple module that parses the output of difflib.ndiff. It takes two strings and exposes a getNextLine() method that returns a dictionary that represents the next line in the diff. The return type always has a 'code' key that contains one of the following values:

    class DiffCode:
        SIMILAR = 0         # line hasn't changed between the files, its diff starts with '  '
        RIGHTONLY = 1       # line exists in the right file only, its diff starts with '+ '
        LEFTONLY = 2        # line exists in the left file only, its diff starts with '- '
        CHANGED = 3         # line has incremental changes on the left file, the diff is represented
                                as three of four lines in the order ('-', '+', '?'), ('-', '?', '+')
                                or ('-', '?', '+', '?')

If the returned code is DiffCode.CHANGED, the result will also contain 'rightchanges' and 'rightchanges' keys, each is a list of indices that have changed on the left and right side respectively. One of these two can be empty but not both.

Usage
-----

    diff = DifflibParser(leftText.splitlines(), rightText.splitlines())
    for d in diff:
        print(d)

left file:

    line1
    lineTwo
    lineThrees
    line4
    line6
    
right file:
    
    line1
    xlineTw0
    lineThree
    line4
    line66

For the two files above, these are the returned results:

    {'code': 0, 'line': 'line1'}
    {'code': 3, 'line': 'lineTwo', 'newline': 'xlineTw0', 'rightchanges': [0, 7], 'leftchanges': [6]}
    {'code': 3, 'line': 'lineThrees', 'newline': 'lineThree', 'rightchanges': [], 'leftchanges': [9]}
    {'code': 0, 'line': 'line4'}
    {'code': 3, 'line': 'line6', 'newline': 'line66', 'rightchanges': [5], 'leftchanges': []}

Which matches the output of difflib.ndiff:

    line1
    - lineTwo
    ?       ^
    + xlineTw0
    ? +      ^
    - lineThrees
    ?          -
    + lineThree
      line4
    - line6
    + line66
    ?      +
